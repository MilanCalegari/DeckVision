# DeckVision

DeckVision is a project that uses artificial intelligence to identify and interpret Tarot cards from images. The system combines:

- **Image Recognition**: Detects Tarot cards in photos
- **Accurate Identification**: Matches cards against a database for identification
- **AI Interpretation**: Generates contextualized readings using language models
- **Simple Interface**: Photo upload and instant reading
- **Multi-card Support**: Analysis of spreads with multiple cards

DeckVision combines modern technology with Tarot tradition to create a unique reading experience.
